### Key Steps: ###
    Embracing open science principles
    Developing open access journals
    Sustatinibility 

**TU Delft OPEN Publishing**, Open Access academic publisher of the TU Delft, publishes Open Access (OA) journals and open (text)-books. The OA journals currently receive not enough support regarding their development. This project aims to bring all OA journals to the same high level of quality expected of any TU Delft product by providing an open publishing developement plan. This project will establish in the long term the identity of TU Delft OPEN Publishing as a trustworthy academic publisher within and beyond TU Delft. The success of the plan is linked to the *open collaboration* of the journal editorial boards. 
The publishing plan will help journals
- Determine their publishing priorities, 
- Target the correct and Identify their readership,
- Evaluate the quality of their publications (Impact), 
- Consider other publishing options (e.g. special Issues, new article types, publishing peer review comments, cascading),  
- Improve communications and networking,
- Diversify the editorial board 
- Contribute to the education of young researchers
- Become and/or remain sustatainable

The plan needs to integrate as much as possible open science principles such as Open Data, Open peer review or authorship transparency in their publishing processes. While the plan will benefit all, It should consider the specificity of each journal and filed.

**Overall the plan has to demonstrate its value to the editorial board.**
